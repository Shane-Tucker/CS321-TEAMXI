#### Introduction
Bored-Game is a top-down board game where the user’s avatar can move around a linear, premade map, collecting points as they travel along the path. The user may also choose to play in singleplayer or multiplayer(unimplemented), collecting points versus a personal high score or against friends. The board may provide additional points based on the spaces that the user lands on or may provide additional obstacles.
--------------------------
#### How to Play
The objective of Bored-Game is to navigate your character across the board by rolling a virtual dice(unimplemented). The board consists of tiles with various features, including shortcuts, challenges, and rewards(unimplemented). The roll of the dice determines how far you can travel on each turn.
Be cautious, though—some tiles might have special effects that can either help or hinder your progress either by sending you back or reducing score.
The game continues until you reach the last tile on the board.
--------------------------
#### Controls
The controls for Bored-Game are incredibly simple. There's just one button to press: the "Roll Dice" key. Click or tap the key on you keyboard (default e) to roll the dice and advance your game piece.
