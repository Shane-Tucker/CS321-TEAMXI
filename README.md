Bored-Game is a top-down board game where the userâ€™s avatar can move around a linear, premade map, collecting points as they travel along the path. The user may also choose to play in singleplayer or multiplayer, collecting points versus a personal high score or against friends. The board may provide additional points based on the spaces that the user lands on or may provide additional obstacles, such as competitive minigames.
